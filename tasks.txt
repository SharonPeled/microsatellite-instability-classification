test:



on hold:
run additive priors, with 10% augs and a lot of resources
do by itself again - fair comparison - waiting to be run after end 1 CV



to do:
add to aug resize and aug
more epochs
Daniel's files

train a simple DINO
load a ViT and fine tune a DINO
load a ViT and fine tune a DINO with my augs.

try 1024 tile with FoVS (224 and 512)

fine tune SSL chosen model (looks like DINO) - try to use all of coad and other unlabeled slides!!
move to mil




thinking:
look at the cleaning phases of Cell and the paper about UCEC
bigger head (3 layered nn)
blur slides ect.. (error analysis)


future:
3/5 CV - on all results before submission
testing on OOD dataset - could be a potential for improvement.


Questions:
differences in high vs low CNV


comments:
    blur slides
    lightly?
