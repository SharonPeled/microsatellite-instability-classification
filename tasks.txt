test:



on hold:




to do:
    quantify the long tail
    summarize papers
    write research proposal
    blur slides ect.. (error analysis, are the False slides same slides?)
    train same data ablation analysis
    pretrained everything
    MIL / agg methods

runs -
    warmup to all non-pretrained parameters - or just pretrain everything?


    check agg methods
other -
    summarize (google sheets) of papers from CVPR and ICCV related to WSI - understand the innovation and what their are looking for.
    train and test on another cohort.
    quantify the long tail and the histograms of the SNPs

general -
    LP stabillization

    Daniel's files
    SSL ViT
    think/move to mil




load a ViT for both student and teacher - warmup the dino heads
load a ViT and fine tune a DINO with my augs.




thinking:
look at the cleaning phases of Cell and the paper about UCEC
bigger head (3 layered nn)


future:
3/5 CV - on all results before submission
testing on OOD dataset - could be a potential for improvement.


Questions:
differences in high vs low CNV


comments:
    blur slides
    lightly?
