test:



on hold:




to do:

    Variants:
    All3 - when finished
    Variants vs variants

    CIN/GS:
    Repeat on MSI - when saving finished - run MIL
    POLE?

    HDR - read more (breast cancer, prostate, brain, ovarian)

    Start refactor all?




preprocessing
pretraining
tile based classifier
MIL classifier

Variant classifier



runs -
other -


general -
train and test on another cohort
Billal label files - do same logic for STAD/UCEC? - Yossi said - not makes sense
CPTAC is publicly available
Wang et al. trained the network using an unsupervised
contrastive loss on data from TCGA and PAIP36 from multiple organs and provided the weights for public use. The embeddings
for each tile are stored for the subsequent training procedure

understand the FoVs - some slides are big with low number of tiles (different Fovs?), does the cell oval size is the same size in all images? (or other common something)
some of the slide has weird tiling - single tile for something that look normal.. (not in labels..)







thinking:
look at the cleaning phases of Cell and the paper about UCEC
repeat the entire process again....(move to tanh)

# rotating validation sets - train test reduce ect
consider pretrain using all and train only using single cohort - in that way you don't increase the number of training sample - could be very interesting
tune on single cohort


future:


Questions:


comments:
    blur slides - not correlated to AUC
    slides mistakes  - looks pretty similar
    lightly?
    slide aware network?
    using positional encoding - not gonna work.
