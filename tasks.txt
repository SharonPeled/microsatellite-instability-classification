test:



on hold:




to do:

runs -
    run bias injection in each MHA - lr, one hot, exclude cohort, cb hyperparam
    shared and sep loss
    according to brain storm - weights according to num tiles? per cohort?

    check whether the low aUC on CRC is due to LP
    check agg methods
other -
    summarize (google sheets) of papers from CVPR and ICCV related to WSI - understand the innovation and what their are looking for.
    train and test on another cohort.

    Daniel's files
    SSL ViT
    think of fusion between datasets
    think/move to mil




load a ViT for both student and teacher - warmup the dino heads
load a ViT and fine tune a DINO with my augs.




thinking:
balanced batches
look at the cleaning phases of Cell and the paper about UCEC
bigger head (3 layered nn)
blur slides ect.. (error analysis)


future:
3/5 CV - on all results before submission
testing on OOD dataset - could be a potential for improvement.


Questions:
differences in high vs low CNV


comments:
    blur slides
    lightly?
