    Daniel's files
    SSL ViT
    think of fusion between datasets
    think/move to mil




load a ViT for both student and teacher - warmup the dino heads
load a ViT and fine tune a DINO with my augs.




thinking:
look at the cleaning phases of Cell and the paper about UCEC
bigger head (3 layered nn)
blur slides ect.. (error analysis)


future:
3/5 CV - on all results before submission
testing on OOD dataset - could be a potential for improvement.


Questions:
differences in high vs low CNV


comments:
    blur slides
    lightly?
