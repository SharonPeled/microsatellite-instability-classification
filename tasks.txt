test:



on hold:
1. per cohort CIN/GS - only stad left
2. cohort prior
3. FoVs aug
4. do on a patient level (and not cohort/patient level)


to do:
add to git slurm_script
fine tune SSL chosen model (looks like DINO) - try to use all of coad and other unlabeled slides!!
move to mil




thinking:
how to combine class weight CIN/GS with learnable priors
look at the cleaning phases of Cell and the paper about UCEC
blur slides ect.. (error analysis)


future:
3/5 CV - on all results before submission
testing on OOD dataset - could be a potential for improvement.


Questions:
differences in high vs low CNV


comments:
    blur slides
    lightly?
