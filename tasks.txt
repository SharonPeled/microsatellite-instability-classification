test:



on hold:


to do:
    action items about variants

    debug the memory in the pooling

    simple tile based experiment
    run an experiment with random 512 tiles and mean agg

    save slides with tile embeddings and locations

    move to other biomarks



runs -
other -


general -
train and test on another cohort
Billal label files - do same logic for STAD/UCEC? - Yossi said - not makes sense
CPTAC is publicly available
Wang et al. trained the network using an unsupervised
contrastive loss on data from TCGA and PAIP36 from multiple organs and provided the weights for public use. The embeddings
for each tile are stored for the subsequent training procedure







thinking:
look at the cleaning phases of Cell and the paper about UCEC


future:
3/5 CV - on all results before submission
testing on OOD dataset - could be a potential for improvement.
Using pretrained HIPT?


Questions:


comments:
    blur slides - not correlated to AUC
    slides mistakes  - looks pretty similar
    lightly?
    slide aware network?
    using positional encoding - not gonna work.
