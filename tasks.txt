test:



on hold:
    research proposal extension


to do:

    fix the label files - do same logic for STAD/UCEC? - ask Yossi tommorow
    symmetry ce loss, tunmor only?



    log in to dgs - slurm, all size of tiles
    mini epochs

    write a summary about the innovation in CIN/GS
    warmup the dino heads



    MIL / agg methods / pooling
    move to to other biomarks

    train and test on another cohort

general -
CPTAC is publicly available
Wang et al. trained the network using an unsupervised
contrastive loss on data from TCGA and PAIP36 from multiple organs and provided the weights for public use. The embeddings
for each tile are stored for the subsequent training procedure







thinking:
look at the cleaning phases of Cell and the paper about UCEC


future:
3/5 CV - on all results before submission
testing on OOD dataset - could be a potential for improvement.
Using pretrained HIPT?


Questions:


comments:
    blur slides - not correlated to AUC
    slides mistakes  - looks pretty similar
    lightly?
    slide aware network? using positional encoding?
