    quantify the long tail - significant when auc > 0.55



test:



on hold:




to do:
    summarize papers
    write research proposal
    train same data ablation analysis
    pretrained everything
    MIL / agg methods

runs -
    -- it overfits when using more data ..., why? should I insert regularization? lower the data? lower lr?
other -
    summarize (google sheets) of papers from CVPR and ICCV related to WSI - understand the innovation and what their are looking for.
    train and test on another cohort.


general -
    LP stabillization
    Daniel's files
    SSL ViT
    think/move to mil




load a ViT for both student and teacher - warmup the dino heads
load a ViT and fine tune a DINO with my augs.




thinking:
look at the cleaning phases of Cell and the paper about UCEC


future:
3/5 CV - on all results before submission
testing on OOD dataset - could be a potential for improvement.


Questions:


comments:
    blur slides - not correlated to AUC
    slides mistakes  - looks pretty similar
    lightly?
