test:


on hold:
preprocess 2048

to do:
start variants!
try different FoVs.

fine tune SSL chosen model (looks like DINO)
remove submodules


move to mil
# till 28, 10 israel, 10$, till 100k
# 0.1% 5,  0.1% 8$, 0.025%

past:
find more papers about UCEC - didn't found anything else.
run 512 & 1024 experiments with different seeds.


thinking:
when increasing FoVs - adjust the tissue threshold
look at the cleaning phases of Cell and the paper about UCEC
calibrated agg
per cohort head - tommorow


Questions:
differences in high vs low CNV, why everybody cite this as 0.87 and 0.65..
