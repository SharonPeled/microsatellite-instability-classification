1)
2) try FoVs aug - 512 base and add all others (224, 1024, 2048(not really maybe) )
3) variants - tell about the experiment and show histogram
    I can show that specific SNPs get high AUC while other not




test:


on hold:


to do:
PER patient scores.. - later

one hot cohort

cohort prior

start variants!
512 work better on UCEC and 1024 on COAD - 3 CV? or continueing CV? or next time?

fine tune SSL chosen model (looks like DINO) - try to use all of coad and other unlabeled slides!!
remove submodules


move to mil


past:
find more papers about UCEC - didn't found anything else.
run 512 & 1024 experiments with different seeds.


thinking:
when increasing FoVs - adjust the tissue threshold
combine different FoVs as aug?
look at the cleaning phases of Cell and the paper about UCEC
calibrated agg
per cohort head - tommorow


Questions:
differences in high vs low CNV, why everybody cite this as 0.87 and 0.65..


comments:
    blur slides
    lightly?
