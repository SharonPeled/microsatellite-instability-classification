test:
1. per cohort CIN/GS
2. cohort prior


on hold:
one hot cohort - decide what to do



to do:
FoVs aug
3 CV

fine tune SSL chosen model (looks like DINO) - try to use all of coad and other unlabeled slides!!
remove submodules


move to mil


past:
find more papers about UCEC - didn't found anything else.
run 512 & 1024 experiments with different seeds.


thinking:
when increasing FoVs - adjust the tissue threshold
combine different FoVs as aug?
look at the cleaning phases of Cell and the paper about UCEC
calibrated agg
per cohort head - tommorow


Questions:
differences in high vs low CNV, why everybody cite this as 0.87 and 0.65..
